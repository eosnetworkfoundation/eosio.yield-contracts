## TLDR

Yield+ is a reward program to attract DeFi dApps that have their own tokenomics for generating yield for their dApp's users. Yield+ itself is not directly generating yield for individual users. Individuals can earn yield by using the dApps that Yield+ is designed to attract.

It can be considered a promotional program or "liquidity incentive/reward program" that pairs well with the EVM launch as both are focused on growing the dApp ecosystem and TVL on EOS. One draws the attention of dApps (Yield+), the other faciliates the participation of dApps outside of EOS (EVM). Native EOS dApps can participate, as well.

It is a effectively incentive based on the True TVL a dApp is bringing into EOS. The application process is to identify the qualifying TVL tier of the dApp, provide information on why a dApp may not qualify, as well as filter out attempts at gaming the reward. The True TVL of each dApp will be automatically and routinely measured to determine the reward tier it achieves. Each dApp can move fluidly up and down through reward tiers based on the True TVL measurement.

It will be necessary (and possible via accompanying, recurrent data analysis) for the community to evaluate the program and weigh whether or not it is of benefit to the EOS ecosystem in effectivly attracting dApps and growing TVL, as well as what measures should be taken to continue, modify, or discontinue the reward program.

The Yield+ Blue Paper provides in detail Research, Analysis, Recommendations, Proposals, Deliverables, Justification, and Discussions on things the community should consider when evaluating the program; e.g., Funding Frequency and Sources presented in the Treasury Recommendations - especially if the program is considered effective and worth continuing.

The Table of Contents can help readers move quickly to the information they desire most, including summaries, discussions, recommendations, and proposals.
